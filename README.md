# Project1_2020_metis
Looking at MTA &amp; Census data to help bring more woman into technology. 

## Problems and Possible Solutions

*In "MVP" order*

**Step 1**: Cleaning data - Finding outliers
1. Filter out outliers (consider 99.7th percentile)
2. (if necessary) Plotting data to visualize outliers
NOTE: Re-sort data and sum by station

**Step 2**: Prepare Presentation
1. Possibly: Jupyter, Power Point

**Step 3**: Demographic Data set filtering (Gender Focussed)
1. Work with "Dataset_1682..." to get "tract" (zipcode like number)
2. Work with "Census tract" to merge "tract" number and find longitude and latitude

**Step 4**: Include Information not found in data sets into presentation
1. All girls schools, Technology Schools, Technology areas (wall street)
2. Maybe just Google, Maybe a data set?

**Step 5**: Use Demographic data to get more info
1. Occupation
