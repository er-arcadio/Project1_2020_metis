# Project1_2020_metis
Looking at MTA &amp; Census data to help bring more woman into technology. 

## Progress and Goals

*In "MVP" order*

**MVP 1**: Cleaning MTA Data & Graphing Findings
1. We used MTA data to find entries and exits per day,
2. Eliminated any outstanding outliers,
3. Sorted the result by station
4. Graphed the result using matplotlib.

**MVP 2**: Demographic Census Data Set
1. We graphed the data using matplotlib sorting by: Women, *Professional*, *Transit Info*
  *Worked with "Census tract" to merge "tract" number and find longitude and latitude*

## We still need to ...

**1. With regards to MTA Data**
1. Sum and sort by Weekday vs Weekend
2. 4 hour block (determine the best time to show up at the station)

**2. With regards to the Census data**
1. Figure out the significance of "Professional" and possibly use it to determine where people working in technology live.
2. Merge the resulting graph with a map of NYC to find the name of near by stations.

**3. With regards to Google**
1. Include Information not found in data sets into presentation
1. All girls schools, Technology Schools, Technology areas (wall street)
2. Maybe just Google, Maybe a data set?

**4. With regars to a presentation**: Prepare Presentation
1. Possibly: Jupyter, Power Point
