# Project1_2020_metis
Looking at MTA &amp; Census data to help bring more woman into technology. 

## The Main Problem Summarized
WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) wants to fill their event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of **women in technology**, and to concurrently **build awareness and reach**. They want to gather the most signitures from people that will contribute to their cause. 


## Progress and Goals

*In "MVP" order*

**MVP 1**: Cleaning MTA Data & Graphing Findings
1. We used MTA data to find entries and exits per day,
2. Eliminated any outstanding outliers,
3. Sorted the result by station
4. Graphed the result using matplotlib.

**MVP 2**: Demographic Census Data Set
1. We graphed the data using matplotlib sorting by: Women
  *Worked with "Census tract" to merge "tract" number and turn longitude and latitude to a "heat map"*
2. Cross referenced that with the NYC subway map to find the "hot spots" based on women-dense locations.


## We still need to ...

**1. With regards to MTA Data**
1. Sum and sort by Best Day of week and
2. Best 4 hour block (determine the best time to show up at the station)

**2. With regards to the Census data**
1. Add pin drops to the heatmap-graph to show the hotspots

**3. With regards to Google**
1. All girls schools, Technology Schools, Technology areas
2. Maybe just Google, Maybe a data set?

**4. Fine tune Presentation & Clean Code**: Prepare Presentation
1. KeyNote
2. Jupyter (.pynb) or .py
