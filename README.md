# Project1_2020_metis
Looking at MTA &amp; Census data to help bring more woman into technology. 

## Presentation
1. Intro - Jon (Present Problem - Highlight key takeaways)
2. Method & tools - Jonathan (MatplotLib - Heat_map & bar_graphs & Google_Search)
3. Results - Manny (visuals bar graphs, heat maps, Top 5s)
4. Conclusion & Recommend - Lucy (pinned maps)
5. Future Work - Lucy (See future work above)


## The Main Problem Summarized (Intro)
WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) wants to fill their event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of **women in technology**, and to concurrently **build awareness and reach**. They want to gather the most signitures from people that will contribute to their cause. 


## Progress (Method and Tools)

**MVP 1**: Cleaning MTA Data & Graphing Findings
1. We used MTA data to find entries and exits per day,
2. Eliminated any outstanding outliers,
3. Sorted the result by station
4. Graphed the result using matplotlib.

**MVP 2**: Plotting Demographic-Census Data and Pinning the HotSpot (Train Stations) Nearby
1. We graphed the data using matplotlib sorting by: Women
  *Worked with "Census tract" to merge "tract" number and turn longitude and latitude to a "heat map"*
2. Cross referenced that with the NYC subway map to find the "hot spots" based on women-dense locations.
3. Add pin drops to the heatmap-graph to show the hotspots

**MVP 3**: Use Niche.com and Google to target Women & Tech areas
1. Created a list of top 5 all girls schools and top 5 tech schools in NYC
2. Pinned the closest top 20 station if it was within walking distance

## Future Work
**We wish we could've looked at MTA data more in depth...**
1. Sum and sort by Best Day of week and
2. Best 4 hour block (determine the best time to show up at the station)

## We still need to ...

**Fine tune Presentation & Clean Code**
1. Jupyter (.pynb) or .py - Clean code
